this repository is a public archive of the Grand Central Library Discord server, a read-only list of resources for writers, worldbuilders, and roleplayers. a description of the GCL, as described on their #welcome channel, is provided below:

> Grand Central Library (GCL) is an ever-evolving collection of writing, roleplaying, and world-building resources. For over two years, the community has helped us collect and compose a vast assortment of useful tools, guides, and how-tos. It's our hope that the curated information contained here will help writers, roleplayers, worldbuilders, loremasters, and server owners alike to create better content for their communities and the Discord RP community as a whole.  
> 
> Each resource can be found indexed by category and sorted by submission date. All authored documents within the library are considered property of their respective authors with free for use under Creative Commons with license for Attribution-Share-Alike (CC BY-SA Copyright) unless otherwise noted. Links to outside material are copyrighted or licensed at the discretion of the webmaster of each resource and are listed here with their permission whenever possible. 
> 
> You may freely use any materials you find here for the betterment of the community. Please, however, provide credit to the authors.

the resource can be found at its [Disboard](https://disboard.org/server/553282299618394154) link.

keep in mind that this repository is not for submitting or requesting resources; that must be done on the Discord server itself.

NOTE: this resource is intended for external markdown editors (like Obsidian), as GitHub's markdown editor tends to collapse line breaks. this may change at a later date (i.e. making everything double line breaks in the future)
